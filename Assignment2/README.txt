Hello professor!

I have decided to go above and beyond with this application, for no other reason than
that I was having a lot of fun coding!

Here is what I added:

    Negative Input: Negative speed will actually move the ball backwards!

    Resizing: The window is able to be resized, and the elements will resize accordingly.

    Ball Color: The ball will change color based on which direction it is moving.

Side Note: I used System.Windows.Form's Timer Class instead. It seems to work just as fine, with one less reference needed.
    Please let me know if that is okay to do for future applications.

If you find that my additions make it more difficult to grade please let me know. I will avoid adding them in the future if so.

Enjoy!
Jared Sevilla
